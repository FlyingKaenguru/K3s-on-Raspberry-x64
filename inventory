# The inventory describes which nodes can be accessed via Ansible.
# The inventory contains the IP addresses or names of the available hosts.
# The entries in the inventory can be grouped if necessary to facilitate management.
# Both individual entries and groups can be linked to variables, for example, to assign a specific NTP server to all hosts in group X.
# In addition, it is possible to obtain the inventory dynamically from other sources as well as to use multiple inventory files in parallel.
